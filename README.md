# Face-recognition

This notebook explores face recognition techniques using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and CNN. It begins by generating a data matrix and label vector from the AT&T database of faces. The data is then visualized to understand its structure and content. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Usage
- Upload the ipynb file on kaggle and add the `AT&T database` as input.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code and observe the results.
- Adjust parameters such as alpha values, KNN neighbors, or CNN architecture to experiment with different configurations.
- Refer to the visualizations and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of each technique.
